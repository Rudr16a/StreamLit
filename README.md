## Introduction

Welcome to the **Streamlit Project on Colab** repository! This project demonstrates how to create interactive web applications using Streamlit and run them directly within Google Colab. Streamlit is a powerful tool for building custom web applications for machine learning and data science projects with minimal code.

## Features

- Build and deploy interactive web applications.
- Integrate with machine learning models.
- Visualize data with ease.
- Run directly in Google Colab with a few steps.

## Tech Stack

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **Google Colab**: An interactive notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser, making it ideal for developing and testing machine learning models and web applications.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project, known for its simplicity and extensive support for machine learning and data science libraries.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library that turns data scripts into shareable web applications in minutes. Streamlit is user-friendly and designed for simplicity and rapid development.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, used for handling arrays and performing numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/streamlit-colab.git
    cd streamlit-colab
    ```

2. Open the `Streamlit_Colab.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install the required packages by running the following command in a Colab cell:
    ```python
    !pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

To use the Streamlit application in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Streamlit_Colab.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

2. Run the setup cell to install the necessary libraries:
    ```python
    !pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```

3. Write your Streamlit app code in a Python script (e.g., `app.py`). Example:
    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    st.title("Streamlit App in Colab")

    st.write("This is a simple example of a Streamlit app running in Google Colab.")

    data = pd.DataFrame({
        'x': np.random.randn(1000),
        'y': np.random.randn(1000)
    })

    st.write(data)

    st.line_chart(data)
    ```

4. Start the Streamlit server from within the Colab notebook:
    ```python
    !streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
    ```

5. After running the above command, you will get a URL from `localtunnel` that you can open in your browser to interact with the Streamlit app.
